# KS Int History
A list of Interpreters written by the Kai Software foundation.
# 2020 - RSharp

RSharp was a pretty poorly-written interpreter written in Python.
It wasn't exactly production ready, was mainly used for fun, testing purposes.

# 2020 - Exclamation Language

Exclamation language (excla) is an easy to use, very useless programming language
with little to no uses like RSharp. Exclamation Syntax goes something like...

```
!print hello!

// !print_all is  all variables ???

!define STD_USE_CXX

!endif
```

# 2020 - RCPScript

RCPScript is a C++ binding around the GNU BASH, CMD, and etc.. command processors.
RCPScript was originally designed for the RCP application, but was later
published to the public for general uses.

Syntax:

```
bash send command(ISender, args) fire {
  echo hello!
}
```

# 2020 - ReConfiguration (recfg)
ReConfiguration (recfg) is a simple programming language which was built
on top of a .INI parser.

ReConfiguration was very messy, and now abandoned.

Syntax:

```

@module mymod

printf(hello, world?)

a = 30

async:printvar(a)

return(20)

```

# 2021 - CustomScript (CS)

CustomScript is a very simple interpreter that like it's predecessors, was
also of no use in the modern world.

**CS8, CS7, And CS6 are all abbreviations of the CustomScript versionings.**

Syntax:

```

function abc()

using Hello\Dev

```

# 2021 - SDKL (OLD)
SDKL is a very strictly typed programming language which used to have no features.
Now it's using it's own VM and contains more features than before.
# 2021 - KASM

Something weird. Used to be of value, and now is obscure.

# 2021 - SDKL (New) 

The new version of SDKL. There's too many features to list here.

# 2021 - PTEX

An engine for writing D TUI.

# 2021 - ISys

ISys is a strictly typed programming language with BASIC-like syntax.
